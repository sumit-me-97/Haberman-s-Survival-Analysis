# Haberman-s-Survival-Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of Haberman's Survival Dataset, which includes breast cancer patient data from 1958 to 1969. The project focuses on identifying factors that influence patient survival using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The insights derived from this analysis contribute to understanding survival trends in historical cancer data.
